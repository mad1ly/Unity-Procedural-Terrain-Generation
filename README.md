**ABOUT THE PROJECT**

This is my implementation of Procedural Terrain Generation Algorithms in Unity Engine!

**Built With**


Unity Engine 2021.3.25f1

**Functionality**


You can freely tweak any setting that affects terrain generation, such as 
- Terrain Size
- Noise Settings
- Generated Landmass type (Island or Square)
- Terrain Amplitude, and how amplitude is calculated on any given heigh (Allows lower and higher height values to be affected differently by amplitude multiplier)
- 2D color map settings (3D Terrain uses more advanced coloring methods, so you need to tweak procedural shaders)
- How much Grass and Trees should be generated


** Usage **

Go to Assets/Scenes and execute the Main.unity scene file. 

In this scene, all of the magic happens in Terrain Generator object in the Hierarchy tab.

Have fun!
